<h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

<p>
These Terms &amp; Conditions apply to the Tiny Weather mobile application (the “Application”), provided by
Usługi Informatyczne Kamil Chmiel (the “Service Provider”) as a Freemium service.
By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Application.
</p>

<h2>1. Use of the Application</h2>
<p>
The Application is intended to be used by parents or legal guardians to help plan children’s outfits and trip packing lists based on weather data.
The Application is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”.
</p>

<h2>2. Important Disclaimer (Informational Only)</h2>
<p>
Tiny Weather provides informational recommendations (including outfit and packing suggestions) based on weather data and user inputs.
The Application does <strong>not</strong> provide medical, health, or professional advice and does not guarantee protection from illness, injury,
or exposure to environmental conditions (including cold, heat, wind, rain, or sun).
</p>
<p>
You remain solely responsible for decisions regarding your child’s clothing, safety, supervision, and wellbeing.
Always use your own judgment and, where appropriate, consult qualified professionals.
</p>

<h2>3. Accuracy of Weather Data and Recommendations</h2>
<p>
While the Service Provider strives to keep the Application accurate and up to date, the Application relies on third-party data sources
(such as weather providers and analytics services). Weather conditions can change rapidly, and predictions may be inaccurate.
The Service Provider does not guarantee that recommendations will be correct, complete, or suitable for your specific situation.
</p>

<h2>4. Account and User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
Some features require you to create an account and log in (e.g., via Google or Apple). You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device
and any access to the Application. Do not share access with unauthorized persons.
</p>
<p>
The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your device, which may compromise device security
and cause the Application to malfunction.
</p>

<h2>5. Outfit Scan and User Content</h2>
<p>
The Application may offer a feature that allows you to submit photos of clothing items for analysis (“Outfit Scan”).
You agree that you will only submit content you have the right to use and that is appropriate for this feature.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do not submit photos containing a child’s face</strong> or other identifiable information.</li>
  <li>Do not submit unlawful, harmful, or offensive content.</li>
  <li>Do not submit sensitive personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Service Provider may restrict or disable access to features if misuse is detected.

<h2>10. Internet, Data, and Mobile Charges</h2>
<p>

Nothing in these Terms limits liability where such limitation is not permitted under applicable law.
